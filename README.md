# Bro Workshop

These are the materials from a workshop on the [Bro IDS](https://www.bro.org/) originally presented at [BSides NoVA](http://www.bsidesnova.org/) 2018.

## The Virtual Machine

Most of the workshop involves interacting with a Ubuntu virtual machine. This VM is downloadable from Release section in VMware OVA format. If you don't have VMware Player/Workstation/Fusion a 30-day trial is available. At least one attendee said they were able to import the VM successfully using VirtualBox, but I have no idea how well it actually runs. As noted in the presentation the default login for the VM is bro:broUser.

## Presentation

The slides for the presentation are available in PDF format.  Some of the slides regarding the shared lab system and WiFi network are no longer relevant, however.

## Exercises

Each exercise is in a named subdirectory and includes a pcap file, a text file with questions (identical to the ones in the presentation), and a text file with my suggested solution or solutions. Spoiler-free hints are available by contacting me per the feedback section below.
