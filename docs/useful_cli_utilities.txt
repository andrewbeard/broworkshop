The Pipe Operator
*	Output of one command is fed into the input of the next
*	Can thinking of it as a filtering and aggregation pipeline
*	In most cases here the first command will be reading from a Bro log file

sudo dmesg | less

grep
*	Search for a string in the input
*	-v inverts the search, printing things that don't contain the string

cat conn.log | grep dns

bro-cut
*	Specify a subset of a bro log
*	Can reorder fields
*	-d converts timestamps to human-readable (but timestamp field must be included)

cat conn.log | bro-cut uid missed_bytes

sort
*	Sort the rows of the input
*	-r for reverse, -n for numbers

cat conn.log | bro-cut missed_bytes uid | sort -n

uniq
*	Remove adjacent duplicated lines
*	-c counts the number of occurrences

cat dns.log | bro-cut query | sort | uniq -c
