# Documents

Included are two quick-reference cards developed by the Bro community. To be clear I've developed neither of these, and claim absolutely no ownership.  They're included in the repo only so each student has a copy available. 

## Corelight-Bro-Cheatsheets-2.5.pdf
A really nice reference for the available Bro logs and what each field means for Bro 2.5.X

## Useful-Command-Line-Utilities.pdf and useful_cli_utilities.txt
Descriptions of a couple command-line test processing utilities which are useful for looking at Bro logs.  This info is taken directly from the workshop slides, but included here as it may be useful as a references for some of the exercises.

## bro-cheat-sheet.pdf
This one deals almost entirely with Bro command line arguments and scripting.  It may come in handy for Exercise 3 in particular when you start modifying and writing your own scripts.
